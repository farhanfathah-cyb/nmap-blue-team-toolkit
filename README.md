# Nmap Blue Team Toolkit

**Brand:** Farhan Mohammed Fathah

GitHub Pages-friendly toolkit:
- Scan Library (search + category + scan dropdown)
- Command Builder (copy/paste)
- Results & SOC notes (sample outputs)
- History + diff (local browser storage)
- Learning-only section (locked entries)

## Deploy
Push to GitHub → Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `/root`.

## Safety
Authorized use only. This website does not perform live scanning.

## Lab Advanced Args
For lab-only advanced testing, use the **Custom Args** field in Command Builder to append your own arguments. The toolkit avoids providing high-risk presets.
