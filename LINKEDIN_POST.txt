🚀 Built a Home Lab Blue Team Tool: Nmap Blue Team Toolkit 🛡️

I created an interactive Nmap command builder (GitHub Pages) designed for authorized blue-team learning:
✅ Scan Library with categories + tags  
✅ Command Builder (copy/paste)  
✅ SOC-style notes + realistic sample outputs  
✅ Command History with TXT/CSV export (local browser storage)

This is built for education and authorized testing only — the site does not run scans itself.
